This can be done by using the command \"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\". Then, you can create a scatter plot by using the \"scatter()\" function and passing in the x and y values as parameters. For example, if you have two lists of data called \"x_data\" and \"y_data\", you can create a scatter plot by using the code \"plt.scatter(x_data, y_data)\". You can also customize your scatter plot by adding labels, titles, and changing the color and size of the points.

The best\\nperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention\\nmechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,\\nbased solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\\nentirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly\\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\\nour model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after\\ntraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\\nbest models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to\\nother tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with\\nlarge and limited training data.\\n1 Introduction\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [ 13] and gated recurrent [ 7] neural networks\\nin particular, have been ﬁrmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\\n∗Equal contribution.
